    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A cannoli is a tube-shaped Italian dessert that consists of fried pastry
      dough stuffed with a sweet, creamy cheese filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crispy pastry shell is made with the usual suspects: flour, sugar,
      whole eggs, and butter. It's usually spiked with marsala, a fortified wine
      that adds distinct flavor and sweetness. The alcohol also helps tenderize
      the pastry, ensuring a pleasantly flaky finished product.

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make shells: Mix flour, sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl.
        Cut in shortening until crumbly. Make a well in the center and add
        Marsala wine, water, vinegar, egg, and egg yolk. Mix with a fork until
        the dough becomes stiff, then finish kneading it by hand on a clean
        surface, adding a bit more water if needed for about 10 minutes. Cover
        with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide cannoli dough into three balls; flatten each one just enough to
        get through the pasta machine. Roll a ball of dough through successively
        thinner settings until you have reached the thinnest setting. Dust
        lightly with flour if necessary. Place the sheet of dough on a lightly
        floured surface. Using a cutter or large glass, cut out 4 to 5-inch
        circles. Dust the circles with a light coating of flour. This will help
        you later in removing the shells from the tubes. Roll dough around
        cannoli tubes, sealing the edge with a bit of egg white. Repeat with
        remaining dough balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry shells on the tubes in hot oil, a few at a time, until golden, about
        2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to turn as needed. Remove shells carefully
        using tongs, and place them on a cooling rack set over paper towels.
        Cool just long enough that you can handle the tubes, then carefully
        twist the tube to remove the shell. Using a tea towel may help you get a
        better grip. Wash or wipe off the tubes, and use them for more shells.
        Cooled shells can be placed in an airtight container and kept for up to
        2 months. You should only fill them immediately or up to 1 hour before
        serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make filling: Mix ricotta cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a
        large bowl until well combined. Fold in chocolate and lemon zest.
        Transfer mixture into a pastry bag and pipe into shells, filling from
        the center to one end, then doing the same from the other side. Dust
        with additional confectioners' sugar to serve, if you like.
