    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Quattro formaggi is a variety of Italian pizza topped with a combination
      of four kinds of cheese, as the name suggests. Traditionally, the cheeses
      should be mozzarella and three other, local cheeses, depending on the
      region, such as Gorgonzola, Fontina, and Parmigiano-Reggiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optionally, the pizza can be further enriched with the addition of basil
      and tomato. The combination of cheeses gives the pizza an unusual, unique
      flavor that is loved by cheese-aficionados all over the world.

            <li>Add the water and olive oil and mix together to form a rough dough</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball then knead on a lightly floured surface for around 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic</li>
            <li>After kneading shape the dough into a ball and place in a large clean bowl lightly greased with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and sit the dough in a dry warm place for 2-3 hours or until tripled in size</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, knock the air out by pressing down on it with your fist. Divide in half and shape into two separate balls ready for baking</li>
